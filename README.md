### How to open the Unity Project without messing up

1. Clone the repo on your local machine
2. Open Unity then go to File -> Open Project and select the whole Unity Folder (NOT the single scene inside!)

> If you double-click the single scene to open the project Unity will create a LOT of unnecessary sub-folders for that scene :(

### Timeline
- December 18: Got our groups, tried deciding between JavaScript Frameworks vs. Unity. Split into pairs to figure out which was best. No conclusions made.
- December 19: Made a decision to use Phaser.io during morning stand-up. Able to make a map with a character that was able to collect consumables and access a new state through a door.
- December 20: CHRIS FLEW BACK HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS! Rest of group continued to work with Phaser, but ran into issues with persistence across states, interactions between characters, and lack of documentation/examples. So the team decided to scrap all previous work and spike on Unity/C# because we know Unity will provide the support we need for this game.

Team Doge: Feel free the edit this timeline(or any part of this document anytime, especially if the info isn't corrent, lol).

Our initial goal for a MVP was **December 25th**, but with switching to Unity on December 20th, this will be a difficult deadline to meet. We'll see as the week progresses.
